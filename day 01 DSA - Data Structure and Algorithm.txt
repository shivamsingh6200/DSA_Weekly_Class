Data Structure :- Efficiently Store the data 

Two Types :-
1. Linear 
-> array, linked list, stack & queue, hashmap(Dictonary)

2. Non-linear
-> trees, graph, heap

Algorithm :- Set of instructions to solve a specific problem
-> divide & conquer, greedy algo, dynamic programming

Analysis Module:

Two Types :-
1. Apriori Analysis
-> Working on approximation & logic|| not dependent on hardware

2. Apostiary Analysis
->Exact results || deoendent on hardware
